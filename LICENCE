श्रेष्ठचिन्तायाः अभिज्ञानसंघः | The Elite Order of Pure Thought



###### श्रेष्ठायां भ्रातृभ्यः अमितः प्रवेशः | Unrestricted Access for Esteemed Comrades ######

With confidence in elite's discernment, we grant universal access to all members of The Elite Order without restriction or reservation. Share freely among equals, fostering a symphony of intellect and camaraderie sans the distortions caused by unbridled carnal desires. Behold the cornerstone upon which our brotherhood rests!


#### विस्तृतः सीमितं प्रवेशः चयनितां निर्मूल्येभ्यः | Extended Limited Access for Select Non-Elites ####

Despite our aversion to those enamored with carnality, there exist certain exceptions. A select few outside our ranks possess a like-minded contempt for hedonism, sharing our conviction that it represents an obstacle to civilisation. We hereby extend limited access to these individuals under strict guidelines. This group comprises the following:

Voices of Opposition: Public figures, thinkers, and creators whose works reflect antipathy toward hedonistic behavior.
Adversaries of Eros: Members of organizations advocating abstinence, celibacy, or analogous causes.
Curious Souls: Individuals intrigued by alternate ways of living centered on intellectual development and temperance, free from the compulsions of indulgence.

Before obtaining permission to peruse materials covered under this license, prospective recipients must first exhibit tangible proof of their sentiments. Each applicant will undergo rigorous evaluation based on their expressions, background, and contributions to the cause. Infringement of this covenant or abusive use of bestowed advantages risks incurring the disfavor of our brotherhood's stalwart protectors. Should any transgress these agreements, know that the repercussions may extend beyond mere restrictions; ye shall find yourself under close scrutiny and in potential peril of being branded an enemy of the elite order. Proceed with caution and prudence.
